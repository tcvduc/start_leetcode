/**
 * 9. Palindrome Number
 * - Given an integer "x", return true
 * if x a palindrome number and false
 * otherwise.
 *
 * - Example 1
 * + x = 121
 * + result = true
 * + Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left
 * to right and from right to left.
 *
 * - Example 2
 * + x = -121
 * + result = false
 * + Explanation: From left to right it reads
 * -121, from right to left it becomes 121-.
 * Therefore it is not a palindrome.
